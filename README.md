# Implementation of POMDPs in Continuous Time and Discrete Spaces

## Installation

It is easiest to setup a virtual environment in order to install the required site-packages without modifying your global python installation. We are using Python3.6 and hence (assuming the code from this repository is in [DIR]), the following lines of code setup the virtualenv and install required packages:

```bash
cd [DIR]
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Scripts for running the example environments are found in the examples folder.

The following commands execute the learning process for the example environments:
```bash
python3 examples/aloha_learning_au.py
python3 examples/aloha_learning_col.py
python3 examples/gridworld_learning_au.py
python3 examples/gridworld_learning_col.py
python3 examples/tiger_learning_col.py
python3 examples/tiger_learning_au.py
```

Simulations are util for the gridworld and slotted aloha problem and can be generated by means of the scripts gridworld_simulation.py and aloha_simulation.py, respectively.

Visualizations can be obtained by means of the scripts aloha_visualization.py, gridworld_visualization.py, and tiger_visualization.py
